Basic Structure of an HTML Website
HTML Document Structure:

Every HTML document starts with a <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, which tells the browser that the document is an HTML5 document.
The document is enclosed within <html> tags, divided into two main sections: <head> and <body>.
Essential Tags and Elements:

<html>: The root element of the document.
<head>: Contains meta-information about the document such as title, character set, and links to stylesheets.
<body>: Contains the content that is visible to the user.

Breakdown of the HTML Structure

1. <!DOCTYPE html>
Declares the document type and version. For HTML5, use <!DOCTYPE html>.

2. <html lang="en">
The root element of the HTML document.
The lang attribute specifies the language of the document (English in this case).

3. <head>
Contains metadata about the HTML document.
Common elements within <head> include:
<meta charset="UTF-8">: Defines the character set.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: Ensures the website is responsive and scales properly on different devices.
<title>: Sets the title of the webpage displayed on the browser tab.
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">: Links to an external CSS stylesheet.

4. <body>
Contains all the visible content of the webpage.
Common elements within <body> include:
<header>: Defines a header for the document, typically containing navigation links and headings.
<nav>: Contains navigation links.
<main>: Contains the main content of the page.
<section>: Represents a standalone section of content.
<footer>: Defines a footer for the document, typically containing copyright and contact information.
