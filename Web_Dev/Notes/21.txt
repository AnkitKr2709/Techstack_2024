CSS specificity is crucial in determining which style rules are applied to HTML elements when multiple rules overlap or conflict. Specificity assigns a value or weight to each CSS selector, and the selector with the highest specificity value takes precedence. Here's a simplified guide to understanding CSS specificity:

## CSS Specificity

CSS specificity helps decide which style will be applied to an HTML element when there are multiple, conflicting CSS rules. It assigns a weight to each CSS selector; the higher the specificity, the more precedence the selector has.

### Example

Consider the following HTML and CSS code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <style>
        * { color: gray; }        /* Universal selector */
        #title { color: red; }    /* ID selector */
        .h1 { color: blue; }      /* Class selector */
        h1 { color: pink; }       /* Element selector */
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 id="title" class="h1" style="color:purple">CodeWithHarry</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

**Question:** What color will be assigned to the `<h1>` element?  
**Answer:** The `<h1>` element will be purple due to the inline style, which has the highest specificity.

## The Cascade Algorithm

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. The cascade algorithm resolves conflicts where multiple CSS rules apply to an element. The cascade has four main stages:

1. **Position and Order of Appearance:** The order in which CSS rules appear matters. The last declared rule will be applied if selectors have the same specificity.
2. **Specificity:** This algorithm calculates which CSS selector has the highest specificity.
3. **Origin:** The order of CSS rules from different sources, like browser styles, CSS from extensions, or your own CSS, affects precedence.
4. **Importance:** Some CSS rules are more heavily weighted than others, especially those with the `!important` declaration.

### Position and Order of Appearance

When two rules have identical specificity, the one declared last will be applied. Styles from inline attributes will override other styles, regardless of their position, unless a declaration is marked as `!important`.

**Example:** 
```html
<!-- The color will be purple due to the inline style -->
<h1 style="color:purple">CodeWithHarry</h1>
```

### Specificity

CSS specificity is calculated based on a point system:

- **Inline Styles**: Highest specificity and always override other styles.
- **ID Selectors**: High specificity, only overridden by inline styles.
- **Class and Attribute Selectors**: Moderate specificity.
- **Element Selectors**: Low specificity.
- **Universal Selector**: Lowest specificity.

**Order of Specificity:**
- Inline Style > ID Selector > Class/Attribute Selector > Element Selector > Universal Selector

### Specificity Calculation

1. **Universal Selector (`*`)**: 0 points
2. **Element Selector and Pseudo-elements**: 1 point each
3. **Class Selectors, Attribute Selectors, and Pseudo-classes**: 10 points each
4. **ID Selectors**: 100 points
5. **Inline Styles**: 1000 points

**Example:**
```html
<h1 id="title" class="h1">CodeWithHarry</h1>
```
- Specificity value: `111` (ID: 100, Class: 10, Element: 1)

**Effect of Specificity:**

```html
<style>
    * { color: gray; }
    #title { color: red; }
    .h1 { color: blue; }
    h1 { color: pink; }
</style>
<!-- The color will be red due to the ID selector -->
<h1 id="title" class="h1">CodeWithHarry</h1>
```

### Importance

The `!important` flag overrides all other styles, regardless of specificity. It should be used sparingly to avoid making the stylesheet difficult to maintain.

**Example:**
```css
p {
    color: red !important;
}

p {
    color: blue;
}
```
The paragraph text will be red because `!important` takes precedence.

## Quick Quiz

**Question:** What is the specificity value of the selector:
```css
a.harryclass.rohan-class[href]:hover {
  color: red;
}
```
**Answer:**  
- Element selector `a`: 1 point
- Class selectors `.harryclass` and `.rohan-class`: 10 points each, totaling 20 points
- Attribute selector `[href]`: 10 points
- Pseudo-class `:hover`: 10 points

**Total Specificity:** `1 (element) + 20 (classes) + 10 (attribute) + 10 (pseudo-class) = 41`

The specificity value is `41`.

**Remember:** In case of a tie, the rule declared last is applied.
